	<h1>Gameplay</h1>
	<p>
		This game looks very gorgeous, it literally looks like really life. The gameplay mechanics are basically the same as any other 3D video games.
		But there are a ton of keys for a lot of different kinds of things. For example, "q" is going into cover, and q in a vehicle is selecting and turning on the radio, etc.(except if you want to change it to other keys)
		The game also have a very big map to play with. It is 50 sqaure miles in size.

		The mechanics for flying flanes and helicopters are kind of confusing, but people get used to it later on.
