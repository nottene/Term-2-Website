	<h1>Personal Connections</h1>
	<p>
		Personally, I think that this game is the best game in the world, because even though this game has been around for more than six years now, it still looks gorgeous compared to some of the games released recently.
		I like this game so much because players can literally do whatever they want in this game, for example: playing tennis, golf and many other things. Sometimes if I am bored, I would just go around and start killing people, and it is actually surprisingly fun.
		To be honest, this is game better than really life. There are no flying cars or rocket-boost motorcycles in really life, but there are in this game.
		I just love the little details in this game and the constant updates to this game, for example: when your character goes into a pool, and let's just say that the water goes to the character's chest, then when the character comes out of the pool, the water marked on the character's shirt would mark where the water level was on the character's chest. I think these little details are amazing, they show how the developers put a lot of work into their games.
		When i play this game, I actually feel like living in really life in this game. When I open my game, it shows me getting up from bed, and ready to go.

		There are two things I don't really like about this game though. The first one is that the loading time for this game is just so longgggggggggggggg!!!
		But I would say that the "in the sky" loading screen animation is actually pretty cool.

		The second thing is that the griefers (The people that kill you for no reason, or they destroy your cargo for no reason, etc.) in this game are so annoying!!!
		They just ride on an oppressor mk2 (or some other weaponized vehiles) and bomb you.
